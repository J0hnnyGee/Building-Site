## TRANSLATION
The project has been translated partially from italian to english. (it was originally in italian because I did it for my university in Italy)
All the Graphic interfaces are in english, but the code (excluding obviously the java code) is in italian (variable and method names).

## HOW TO USE IT
The repo has two main folders:
-one for the databse
-one for the java part

### Database
The database has been developed using PostgreSQL, in the Database folder there are all the tables and sequences.
There is also a .backuo file, than can be imported in pgAdmin 4 to test the database (here the datas and tables are still in italian).

### Java
In the java part the is the source folder with all the code, divided in controller, Guis, daos, entities and table models.
The librairies used for the project are: jcalendar, jgoodies, joda time and miglayouot.
